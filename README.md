# Online-Phone-Store

I developed a Full Stack Web Application by:
Building an online phone store with a basic frontend UI
Implementing NodeJS to run a backend server to operate all CRUD functions
Managing a MongoDB collection which stored instances of 3 JSON Objects
(The User "Personal Detail", The Phone "Item Details", The Order "Order Details")
